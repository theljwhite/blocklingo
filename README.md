# Blocklingo

This is a multi step browser word puzzle game, with the first step similar to the game Connections and the second step similar to the game Contexto. Allows users to optionally connect a crypto wallet to Polygon Amoy testnet blockchain and earn ERC20 cryptocurrency tokens as they play and solve puzzles.

Made from September 21, 2024 through October 28, 2024 during Newforce. Uses TypeScript React & Vite, C# ASP.NET, and some quick Solidity smart contracts using Hardhat, an Ethereum development environment.
